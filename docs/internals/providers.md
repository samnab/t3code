# Provider architecture

> For maintainers. Using T3 Code? See [docs/user](../user/).

A provider is the agent runtime that does the actual work. T3 Code supports several, and the
orchestration layer does not know which one is behind a thread.

Orchestration records intent and state without knowing which provider runs a thread. Provider
protocols, account ownership, permissions, and capabilities belong at the
[adapter boundary](../../apps/server/src/provider/Services/ProviderAdapter.ts). Normalize there
instead of spreading provider checks through reactors and clients.

A driver kind identifies an integration; an instance identifies one configuration and account
lifecycle. Route work by instance, so two accounts using the same driver do not share mutable
session or catalog state.

## Built-in drivers

[`builtInDrivers.ts`][drivers] exports `BUILT_IN_DRIVERS` with these entries:

| Driver kind   | Driver source                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `codex`       | [`Drivers/CodexDriver.ts`][codex]             |
| `claudeAgent` | [`Drivers/ClaudeDriver.ts`][claude]           |
| `cursor`      | [`Drivers/CursorDriver.ts`][cursor]           |
| `grok`        | [`Drivers/GrokDriver.ts`][grok]               |
| `pi`          | [`Drivers/PiDriver.ts`][pi]                   |
| `opencode`    | [`Drivers/OpenCodeDriver.ts`][opencode]       |
| `antigravity` | [`Drivers/AntigravityDriver.ts`][antigravity] |

Each driver declares its `driverKind`, a `configSchema`, and a `create` function that builds an
adapter in a child scope. Adapter implementations live beside them in
`apps/server/src/provider/Layers/` (`CodexAdapter.ts`, `ClaudeAdapter.ts`, `PiAdapter.ts`, and so on) and conform to
[`ProviderAdapter.ts`][adapter]. Read the driver plus its adapter to see how a specific agent's
transport, config, and event shapes are mapped.

## Registry and routing

Two registries separate configuration from live processes:

- [`ProviderInstanceRegistry`][instances] keys configured instances by `ProviderInstanceId`. Creating
  one looks up the driver by `driverKind`, decodes `entry.config` with that driver's schema, opens a
  child scope, and calls `driver.create`.
- [`ProviderAdapterRegistry`][registry] resolves an instance ID to its live adapter via
  `getByInstance`.

[`ProviderService`][service] sits on top. It combines the adapter registry with the provider session
directory to route session and turn operations for a thread, so callers name a thread, not an agent.

`ProviderService.sendTurn` expands [assistant citations](./assistant-citations.md) into quoted
reference data before dispatching to any adapter. Bound user comments remain distinct from the quoted
assistant text. Persisted messages keep their serialized links.

Adding a driver means writing the driver plus adapter and adding it to `BUILT_IN_DRIVERS`. No
orchestration, contract, or client change is required for the common case.

## Process and account isolation

T3-managed OpenCode chat uses one server per thread. Its MCP registrations are directory-scoped, while
T3's MCP connection is thread-scoped. Sharing a chat server between threads in one directory would
let them replace each other's connection. Catalog and text-generation work can share the
[instance-owned helper](../../apps/server/src/provider/OpenCodeServerOwner.ts), which closes
after an idle period. External OpenCode servers remain externally owned and can require an
external restart to pick up configuration changes.

OpenCode also stores persistent approval grants per directory. Automatic full-access replies use
`once` so they cannot widen a supervised thread's permissions on a shared external server.
See the [adapter](../../apps/server/src/provider/Layers/OpenCodeAdapter.ts).

Antigravity separates account profiles per instance while sharing installed executables across the
environment. It forces file-based credential storage because the native macOS keychain entry would
otherwise be shared across instances. The launch environment removes ambient Google credentials,
so an instance cannot silently use another account or billing project. The agent also resolves
its user-global skill directories under that profile, so the profile links those two directories
back to the user's real `~/.gemini`; MCP servers, hooks, and rules there stay out of the profile.
See [profile isolation](../../apps/server/src/provider/antigravityAuthSupport.ts).

The [Antigravity installer](../../apps/server/src/provider/AntigravityInstallation.ts) outlives
client connections and provider-instance rebuilds. Releases are immutable, with an atomic pointer
selecting the version for new processes. Running processes hold leases on their version. Updates
and removal must respect those leases instead of replacing executables under a running agent.

## Setup must not happen as a health-check side effect

Opening a provider session can start MCP servers, run hooks, or launch a login browser.
[Grok probes](../../apps/server/src/provider/Layers/GrokProvider.ts) avoid authentication and
session creation for this reason. Antigravity likewise reserves authenticated catalog sessions for
explicit setup or model refresh; background checks use initialization only.

[Antigravity sign-in](../../apps/server/src/provider/AntigravityAuth.ts) belongs to the initiating
T3 auth session. The client carries the return URL back to the environment because the provider's
loopback listener may be on another machine. Forward only the callback for the owned pending flow;
a successful callback HTTP request is not proof that provider authentication finished. The native
process owns token exchange and storage.

Antigravity sign-out closes admission to new processes and stops existing processes before clearing account
metadata. Otherwise a helper or resumed session could retain the old account. Cached model lists
do not establish current access, and an authoritative empty catalog must clear the old list.

Antigravity text-generation helpers deny tool requests, but native hooks and MCP configuration can
run before the prompt. They reject profiles with such configuration before launch. Prompt
instructions and tool denial do not create a native sandbox.
See [helper constraints](../../apps/server/src/textGeneration/AntigravityTextGeneration.ts).

Pi's optional manager protocol is documented in [Pi subagent control plane](./pi-subagent-control-plane.md).

### Grok health check

`checkGrokProviderStatus` never opens an ACP session. It runs `grok --version`, then `grok models`
for login state and model slugs, then a single ACP `initialize` and reads models from
`_meta.modelState`. `authenticate` and `session/new` are skipped on purpose: `authenticate` can open
a browser login and `session/new` boots every configured MCP server, both of which made background
probes hang or surprise the user. A failed `initialize` degrades to `warning` with the CLI's model
list instead of persisting `error` over a working install. The built-in `grok-build` slug is the
CLI's product name, not an ACP model id. `applyGrokAcpModelSelection` treats it as "keep the
session's current model" and never sends it in `session/set_model`.

## Provider updates run only through the owning installer

A one-click update is offered only when the resolved executable's path proves which installer owns
it. Homebrew and npm are proven by the real path (symlinks followed): a versioned keg or cask under
`brew --prefix`, or `<prefix>/lib/node_modules/<pkg>/` (Windows: the shim beside `node_modules`).
Native installer layouts and the global bin directories of pnpm, Bun, and Vite+ may match on either
the resolved path or its real target, since those installers place real files or their own symlinks
there. Anything unproven stays manual-only but still reports the version gap. npm updates pin
`--prefix` because the `npm` on `PATH` can belong to a different Node than the one that owns the
provider. Homebrew
compares against `brew info` since casks trail npm by hours; native installs share npm's version
train, so the registry stays authoritative for them.
See the [resolver](../../apps/server/src/provider/providerMaintenance.ts).

Ownership is cached per instance and re-read immediately before an update runs. The
[runner](../../apps/server/src/provider/providerMaintenanceRunner.ts) refuses when the lock key
changed since the advisory, and reports success only when the refreshed provider is still installed
with a readable, current version.

## Protocol traps

Codex async questions arrive as notifications and are answered with a new user message. There is
no pending RPC response to send. Blocking questions still use the request/response path. The
[adapter](../../apps/server/src/provider/Layers/CodexAdapter.ts) distinguishes them; the
[decider](../../apps/server/src/orchestration/decider.ts) records an async answer and its user
message together.

An async question can outlive the turn or a server restart. The engine reads that request's
durable activity before resolving it because the in-memory command snapshot omits old activities.
Do not infer that a request has disappeared merely because it is outside the recent window.

Capabilities must describe what the provider can actually do. Antigravity can capture workspace
checkpoints but cannot roll back its conversation. The [checkpoint boundary](./overview.md#turn-completion-and-checkpoints)
therefore rejects revert before touching files. Native permission and question option IDs must
also survive normalization; a display label is not necessarily a valid reply.

## Attachments and stored history

Attachments live outside the project workspace. [ProviderService](../../apps/server/src/provider/Layers/ProviderService.ts)
puts their environment-local paths in turn input and lets adapters choose native input formats.
A path in the prompt does not grant filesystem access. Keep provider sandbox and approval rules
in force; copying uploads into the project to bypass them changes that boundary.

File attachments introduced a replay compatibility limit. Image-only clients cannot decode
file-bearing messages, and an image-only server can fail the entire environment's startup when
replaying one such event. Rollouts and downgrades must account for persisted history as well as
current client support.

Model classification has its own [manifest constraints](./model-manifest.md). Assistant-reference
handling is documented under [citations](./assistant-citations.md).

## Model manifest

The model picker's legacy section is driven by `apps/server/src/provider/model-manifest.json`, which
lists the current (non-legacy) model slugs per driver kind. The `ModelManifest` service
(`apps/server/src/provider/ModelManifest.ts`) refreshes that data from the same file on `main` via
raw.githubusercontent.com, so moving a model in or out of the legacy section is a commit, not a
release. Preference order is remote fetch, then the on-disk copy of the last successful fetch (in
the state directory), then the bundled copy. Fetches are TTL-gated, run concurrently with provider
probes, respect the `enableProviderUpdateChecks` setting, and never fail a provider check. The
Codex and Claude drivers apply the classification to every snapshot with `applyModelManifest`;
driver kinds absent from the manifest have no legacy concept. Pi is absent by design: its snapshot
discovers the installed Pi model catalog and the user's configured default through RPC.

## Attachment access

The server stores uploaded attachments in its attachment directory, outside the project workspace.
`ProviderService` adds the absolute path of each attachment to the turn text, then passes every
attachment to the provider adapter. Each adapter decides what its provider ingests natively:

- Codex, Claude, Cursor, and Grok send images as native image inputs and skip generic files. For
  these providers, generic files reach the agent only as file paths in the turn text.
- Pi sends supported images through RPC as typed native image inputs. Pi RPC has no typed generic
  file payload, so generic files reach Pi only as file paths in the turn text.
- OpenCode sends PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP images, text files, and PDFs up to 20 MB as native file parts
  with their real mime type. Everything else (ZIP and other binaries, image formats model APIs
  reject, oversized files) falls back to the file path in the turn text, like the other providers.

Claude receives the attachment directory as an allowed additional directory. Codex keeps its
configured sandbox policy, so access depends on that policy and the selected runtime mode. OpenCode
allows all paths in full-access mode and requests approval for directories outside the workspace in
restricted modes. Cursor and Grok use their own provider permission rules.

The server does not copy attachments into a project or bypass provider approval rules. If an agent
cannot read an attachment, the user must approve the access or select a runtime mode that permits it.

Updated attachment schemas tolerate unknown attachment members, but old image-only clients still
cannot decode messages that contain file attachments. Client file-picking rollouts must account for
this limit.

Do not run an old image-only server against state that contains file attachments. Replay decodes
each persisted event before projection. A file-bearing event can make `ProjectionPipeline` bootstrap
and `OrchestrationEngine` startup fail for the entire environment, not only the affected thread.

## How provider work is requested

Clients never call a provider directly. They dispatch orchestration commands over the RPC method
`orchestration.dispatchCommand`, defined with the rest of the orchestration surface in
[`orchestration.ts`][contracts]. The client-dispatchable provider-facing commands are
`thread.turn.start`, `thread.turn.interrupt`, `thread.approval.respond`,
`thread.user-input.respond`, `thread.checkpoint.revert`, `thread.session.stop`, and
`thread.context.compact`, plus the mode setters `thread.runtime-mode.set` and
`thread.interaction-mode.set`.

`thread.context.compact` requests provider-native manual context compaction. The decider rejects
busy threads (running session, queued turn start, open approval or user-input request); the reactor
re-checks live session state, de-duplicates in-flight requests, and reports failures as a
`provider.context.compact.failed` activity. T3 only requests compaction — the provider authors and
owns the summary, and nothing about it (text, model, threshold) crosses the command. Providers
declare their mode on the `ServerProvider` snapshot: `contextCompaction: "prompt"` (Claude — the
client sends `/compact` as a normal turn) or `"native"` (Codex `thread/compact/start`, Pi's
`compact` RPC). Cursor, Grok, and OpenCode declare nothing and the control stays hidden.

The engine persists an event for the command, and a server-side reactor performs the provider call.
Provider output comes back as internal commands such as `thread.message.assistant.delta` and
`thread.session.set`, which clients observe through `orchestration.subscribeThread`. See
[overview.md](./overview.md) for the command/event loop.

## Subscription usage limits

`account.rate-limits.updated` carries a normalised payload — `{ windows, replace }`, where each
window is `{ id, label, usedPercent, resetsAt }` with `resetsAt` in unix milliseconds. Each adapter
normalises at its own boundary (`apps/server/src/provider/usageLimits.ts`), so nothing downstream
sees a provider-native rate-limit shape:

- **Codex** maps its `primary`/`secondary` snapshot with `replace: true`.
- **Claude** maps one SDK `rate_limit_event` at a time with `replace: false`, so clients merge by
  window id. Unknown window keys pass through with a title-cased label rather than being dropped.
- **Pi** has no native usage reporting, so GLM sessions read z.ai's quota endpoint once per session
  start and once per completed turn, behind a five-minute cache
  (`apps/server/src/provider/zaiUsageLimits.ts`). It never fails into the turn path.

Ingestion turns the event into a `usage-limits.updated` thread activity carrying the provider,
which clients fold with `mergeUsageLimitActivities` in `@t3tools/client-runtime/state/usage-limits`.

## Server-side workers

Provider work flows through three queue-backed workers. All three are built with
`makeDrainableWorker` from [`DrainableWorker.ts`][worker] and expose `drain` for deterministic test
synchronization.

1. [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest] consumes provider runtime streams and emits orchestration
   commands.
2. [`ProviderCommandReactor`][cmd] reacts to orchestration intent events and dispatches provider
   calls.
3. [`CheckpointReactor`][checkpoint] captures workspace checkpoints on turn start and completion, and
   performs reverts.

### Buffered assistant delivery

A thread in `buffered` assistant delivery mode accumulates assistant text instead of streaming each
delta. The buffer is not held until turn completion. In [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest],
`MAX_BUFFERED_ASSISTANT_CHARS` is 24,000: the append that would exceed it invalidates the buffer and
spills the whole accumulated text as one delta. The buffer also flushes at interaction boundaries,
when a request opens (approval) or user input is requested, via
`flushBufferedAssistantMessagesForTurn`.
